Our dataset contains 364 images (and 4888 annotations!) is hosted publicly on Roboflow [here](https://public.roboflow.ai/object-detection/bccd).\n","\n","When adapting this example to your own data, create two datasets in Roboflow: `train` and `test`. Use Roboflow to generate TFRecords for each, replace their URLs in this notebook, and you're able to train on your own custom dataset.\n","\n","### **Our Model**\n","\n","We'll be training a Faster R-CNN neural network. Faster R-CNN is a two-stage detector: first it identifies regions of interest, and then passes these regions to a convolutional neural network. The outputted features maps are passed to a support vector machine (SVM) for classification. Regression between predicted bounding boxes and ground truth bounding boxes are computed. (Consider [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/faster-r-cnn-object-detection-implemented-by-keras-for-custom-data-from-googles-open-images-125f62b9141a) deep dive for more!)\n","\n","The model arechitecture is one of many available via TensorFlow's [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md#coco-trained-models).\n","\n","### **Training**\n","\n","Google Colab provides free GPU resources. Click \"Runtime\" → \"Change runtime type\" → Hardware Accelerator dropdown to \"GPU.\"\n","\n","Colab does have memory limitations, and notebooks must be open in your browser to run. Sessions automatically clear themselves after 12 hours.\n","\n","### **Inference**\n","\n","We'll run inference directly in this notebook, and on three test images contained in the \"test\" folder from our GitHub repo. \n","\n","When adapting to your own dataset, you'll need to add test images to the `test` folder located at `tensorflow-object-detection/test`.\n","\n","### **About**\n","\n","[Roboflow](https://roboflow.ai) makes managing, preprocessing, augmenting, and versioning datasets for computer vision seamless.\n","\n","Developers reduce 50% of their boilerplate code when using Roboflow's workflow, automate labelling quality assurance, save training time, and increase model reproducibility.\n","\n","#### ![Roboflow
